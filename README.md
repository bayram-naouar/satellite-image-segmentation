## ⚙️ How to Use

1. **(Optional)** Augment the dataset:
```bash
python augment_data.py
```

2. **Train the model**:
```bash
python train.py
```

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🔧 Configuration

All important settings for data paths, training behavior, and model architecture are centralized in the config.yaml file.
This allows you to easily customize the project without modifying the core scripts.
You can change dataset directories (```image_dir```, ```mask_dir```, ```augmented_image_dir```, ```augmented_mask_dir```) or enable/disable data shuffling.
Under the training section, you can tune hyperparameters such as ```batch_size```, ```image_size```, ```number of epochs```, ```learning_rate```, and ```dropout_rate```.
If you want to include augmented data during training, simply set ```use_augment``` to ```true```.
Finally, the model section lets you specify which architecture to use (currently supports "unet").
Adjust these values as needed to experiment with performance or scale the pipeline to different datasets.
